# CL1off

The package provides Matlab code for the simulation of one-off cases and for the crime linkage analyses introduced in the manuscript "Linking serial homicide – towards an ecologically valid application" by Pakkanen, T., Sirén, J., Zappalà, A., Jern, P., Bosco, D., Berti, A. and Santtila, P. The package does not include the original data necessary to reproduce the results. The code has been developed and tested with Matlab R2019b under Windows 10. 

-------

The script loadData.m loads the data from the Excel-file (not included in the package).

The simulations and analyses can be reproduced with the script analyses.m.

The figures in the manuscript can be reproduced with script figures.m.
